Holographic Multiplexing In article number 2100273, Zhengzhong Huang and Liangcai Cao introduce Kramers–Kronig relation into the off-axis holographic multiplexing technology to realize the maximum spatial bandwidth utilization of single multiplexed hologram. This helps to improve the iterative-free and constraint-free performance of a quantitative optical system, enlarging and empowering applications in high-throughput, large-scale studies of computational microscopy and biological tissue analysis.
